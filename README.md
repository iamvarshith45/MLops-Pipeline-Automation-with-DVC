# MLops-Pipeline-Automation-with-DVC
Engineered an end-to-end ML pipeline using DVC (Data Version Control) to automate 5 sequential stages: data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, reducing manual workflow by 90% <br>

Designed modular Python scripts with clear dependency tracking, enabling 100% reproducibility and automated versioning of datasets (CSV) and models (.pkl). <br>

Built and trained a Gradient Boosting Classifier on a custom dataset of size 50,000+ samples, achieving 87% accuracy, 85% precision, and 0.91 AUC-ROC on test data <br>

Saved trained models using pickle, enabling consistent inference and seamless integration into downstream applications. <br>

Configured dvc.yaml pipeline and tracked metrics.json for model performance monitoring and historical comparisons over multiple experiments. <br>

Achieved 5x faster experimentation using DVCâ€™s smart caching and pipeline graph execution, with minimal resource re-computation. <br>

Ensured scalability and collaboration by integrating DVC with Git, supporting consistent workflows across multiple environments. <br>
